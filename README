Functional Programming Introductory Course
==========================================

In conjunction with a couple of brave and talented Atlassian developers, NICTA is offering local developers the opportunity to get a hands-on taste for functional programming specifically targeted at an introductory level audience. Prior programming experience is a requirement, however you may not know what functional programming even means, or perhaps you can vaguely recall some traumatic Haskell or Scheme course in undergrad which you have since wiped from your memory. If you are curious to get into this subject and start picking up the tools to apply it in your work, then this course is for you.

Date

23/24 January 2013 *(all day)*

Location
--------
Australian Technology Park
Room L4.60, Level 5, 13 Garden Street, Eveleigh, NSW 2015
[Map](http://goo.gl/maps/0pWdw "Map")

Pre-requisites
--------------
You will need to bring with you a suitable development machine, installed with Glasgow Haskell Compiler [GHC] [1]. You might instead choose to install The Haskell Platform [THP] [2] which also contains all the necessary pre-requisites. It will also be helpful to have `git` installed for managing your source code.


Expectations
------------
You will be writing source code for most of the day using the Haskell programming language. There will also be breaks to go deeper into discussions of various subjects. The specific topics that we visit will be largely guided by the audience. For example, many people want to know what this mysterious monad thing is and why it matters -- sure we can cover that and qualify you for your Monad Licence.

The overarching goal to have a lot of challenging fun and learn as much as we can squeeze into two days, however, be assured that you will have a sore head by the end of day two.

FAQ

* What if this all goes pear-shaped and I need to contact you urgently?

Call me `0408711099`

* What if I really want to attend but there are no more places available?

I will be re-running this course if there is more demand that can be
handled in one round. I will not leave anybody behind, promise. More
long-term, I also hope to advance those who wish to pursue the subject
further beyond an introductory level.
