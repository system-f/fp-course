Written by Tony Morris 2010
---------------------------


The course is structured according to a linear progression and uses
the Haskell programming language to learn programming concepts.
Module L[N] must be completed before module L[N+1] unless otherwise stated.
The existing code compiles, however answers have been replaced with calls
to the Haskell error function.

Exercises are annotated with a comment containing the word "Exercise."
Some exercises contain hints, which are annotated between ~~~ like this ~~~.
