0.1.2

Switch around the the hex parser exercise. There are now two exercises:

1. Implement `hex`, which is a sub-exercise of the previous `hex`.
2. Implement `hexu`, which is the complete exercise of what was formerly `hex`.

This switching is required to implement `jsonString` parser properly (without a try-parser).
